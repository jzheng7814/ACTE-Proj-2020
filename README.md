# JCHS-Chemistry-Department-Grade-Spreadsheet-Organizer
(ACTE Project Submission: 2020)

This project was developed for the James Clemens High School Chemistry Department and submitted as a project to the ACTE Tech Fair Presentation.

The JCHS Chemistry Department administers homework in the form of Google Forms with chemistry problems, automatically checked for correct answers with results returned to the student. Students can submit infinitely many times. This creates the problem that each student for the homework will have many different submissions. Compound this with the fact that there are about 90-180 PreAP/AP Chemistry students at one time, and this makes putting the grade into the gradebook for homework extremely difficult.

This Python code (Google Apps Script version existing, but not present) organizes the spreadsheet to remove duplicate entries per student (taking the highest grade), sort students by class block, thenlast name, then first name. This function reduced necessary homework grading time from 6 hours to 15 minutes.
